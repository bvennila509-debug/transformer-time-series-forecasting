# Advanced Time Series Forecasting — Attention-Based Transformer

This repository implements an attention-based Transformer model for univariate and multivariate time-series forecasting.
It contains a reproducible training script, a synthetic dataset generator, utilities for evaluation, and a human-readable
technical report that explains methodology, experiments, and interpretation (ready for submission).

Run the minimal example (CPU-friendly) to generate data, train for a few epochs, and evaluate.

See `report/report.md` for the narrative write-up to submit.
